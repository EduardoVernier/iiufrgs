\chapter{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
We believe this work was a worthy debut on the software visualization field. From scratch and without support of specialized libraries, we have built a tool that combines long-established visualization techniques (e.g. treemaps, spectrographs) with state of the art approaches to understanding multidimensional time-dependent data. Pushing these techniques to their limits, we were able to understand where they fail, and motivate ourselves to create future work that tackles these challenges.

Furthermore, the developed software quality metric extraction process was a nice feat and it has already been put to use in other interesting work in the softvis field \cite{ref:silva2}. Hopefully our contribution doesn't end here, as there are many improvements to be made if we want to take this tool to the next level.
